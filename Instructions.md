# PLEASE: Test Data

### Instructions:
To ensure the test data included with the PLEASE source repository can be loaded into the software, the configuration script config_test_data.py must be run beforehand.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Change directory to the PLEASE TestData directory

     ```cd PATH/TO/PLEASE/TestData/
     ```
3. Run the configuration script:

    ```python config_test_data.py
    ```

4. You should see output to your terminal indicating the reading and writing of settings to the test data .yaml config files
5. If the script was successful, you should be able to load the four test experiment data sets by clicking the "Load Experiment" button from the PLEASE software, navigating to one of the directories contained in the TestData directory, and selecting an Experiment.yaml file to load.
