Module containing classes which act as containers for
LEED and LEEM data sets. Each objects has a main data
construct consisting of a 3d numpy array which is filled
by reading in a stack of data files in either an image format
or raw binary data.

Alongside the 3d numpy array there must be some type of list or
container for energy parameters which corresponds directly to the
third axis of the numpy array.
